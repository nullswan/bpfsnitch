bpfsnitch is an open-source, real-time monitoring tool for Linux systems and Kubernetes clusters. Inspired by GlassWire, bpfsnitch leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to provide observability at the lowest level possible by tracking system calls and network activities. It is capable of monitoring every syscall and network event in real-time, offering valuable insights into what's happening inside your systems and containers.

## Installation

### On Kubernetes Clusters

Deploy bpfsnitch as a DaemonSet to monitor all nodes in your cluster.

1. Apply the DaemonSet Manifest

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nullswan/bpfsnitch/main/deployments/daemonset.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Metrics

bpfsnitch exposes a variety of Prometheus metrics, providing insights into syscalls and network activities.

### Key Metrics

- Syscall Counters: Counts of specific syscalls made by processes or pods.
- Network Bytes Counters: Total bytes sent and received, labeled by pod and remote subnets.
- Network Packets Counters: Total packets sent and received.
- DNS Query Counters: Number of DNS queries made by pods.

## Performance

Starting from v0.1.0, bpfsnitch is built to be lightweight and efficient using eBPF technology. It monitors syscalls and network events at the kernel level, providing real-time insights with minimal system impact.

In production, bpfsnitch typically uses an average of 5ms of CPU per 60-second scrape and maintains a memory footprint of up to `250MB`. It is statically bound to a maximum of `100ms` CPU usage, ensuring consistent performance regardless of system configuration or workload. See the [DaemonSet resources](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Anullswan/bpfsnitch%20resources&type=code)

To monitor bpfsnitch's performance in real-time, start it with the -pprof flag to expose a pprof server. Access live profiling data at the /debug/pprof route to analyze CPU and memory usage and optimize performance as needed.

We are committed to providing detailed performance benchmarks and optimization tips in future releases to help you maximize bpfsnitch's benefits.

## Configuration (soon)

### Customizing Syscall Monitoring

bpfsnitch comes with a predefined list of syscalls to monitor, focusing on critical operations that could affect system security or stability. We plan to provide a configurable syscall whitelist in future releases, allowing you to tailor monitoring to your specific needs.

#### Predefined Syscalls

```go
var WhitelistedSyscalls = []int{
    SyscallToId["clone"],
    SyscallToId["execve"],
    SyscallToId["mknodat"],
    SyscallToId["chroot"],
    SyscallToId["mount"],
    SyscallToId["umount2"],
    SyscallToId["pivot_root"],
    SyscallToId["setuid"],
    SyscallToId["setgid"],
    ...
```

## Educational Value

bpfsnitch is not only a powerful monitoring tool but also an excellent educational resource. It provides insights into:
- eBPF Programming: Learn how eBPF programs are written and attached to kernel functions.
- System Call Mechanics: Understand how syscalls work and how they impact system behavior.
- Kernel-Level Monitoring: Gain knowledge about low-level monitoring techniques in Linux.
- Observability Practices: Explore how to collect and expose metrics for modern monitoring systems like Prometheus.

## License

bpfsnitch is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## Future Plans

- Configurable Syscall Whitelist: Allow users to define which syscalls to monitor.
- User Interface: Develop a web-based UI for easier visualization and management.
- Performance Optimizations: Enhance the efficiency of data collection and processing.
- Additional Metrics: Include more granular metrics, such as latency measurements and error counts.
- Extended Container Support: Improve compatibility with various container runtimes and orchestration platforms.
