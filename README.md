bpfsnitch is an open-source, real-time monitoring tool for Linux systems and Kubernetes clusters. Inspired by GlassWire, bpfsnitch leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to provide observability at the lowest level possible by tracking system calls and network activities. It is capable of monitoring every syscall and network event in real-time, offering valuable insights into what's happening inside your systems and containers.

## Installation

### On Kubernetes Clusters

Deploy bpfsnitch as a DaemonSet to monitor all nodes in your cluster.

1. Apply the DaemonSet Manifest

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nullswan/bpfsnitch/main/deployments/daemonset.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Metrics

bpfsnitch exposes a variety of Prometheus metrics, providing insights into syscalls and network activities.

### Key Metrics

- Syscall Counters: Counts of specific syscalls made by processes or containers.
- Network Bytes Counters: Total bytes sent and received, labeled by container and remote IP.
- Network Packets Counters: Total packets sent and received.
- DNS Query Counters: Number of DNS queries made by containers.

### Example Metrics Output

## Performance

bpfsnitch is engineered to be lightweight and highly efficient, utilizing eBPF technology to minimize overhead. By monitoring syscalls and network events at the kernel level, it provides real-time insights without significantly impacting system performance.

In our extensive testing across various Linux distributions and Kubernetes clusters, bpfsnitch exhibited minimal resource consumption and negligible performance impact. The eBPF programs it employs are optimized for efficiency, ensuring that monitoring activities do not interfere with normal system operations. Even in high-traffic production environments, bpfsnitch operates smoothly without causing any noticeable degradation.

Typically, bpfsnitch consumes less than 1% of a CPU and maintains a memory footprint ranging from 50 to 100 MB per node. These figures may vary based on system configuration, workload, and monitoring settings.

To help you monitor bpfsnitch's performance in real-time, you can expose a pprof server by starting bpfsnitch with the -pprof flag. This enables you to access live profiling data through the /debug/pprof route, allowing you to analyze CPU and memory usage on the fly. Utilizing pprof, you can gain deeper insights into bpfsnitch's resource consumption and optimize its performance according to your needs.

Of course, we are committed to providing more detailed performance benchmarks and optimization tips in future releases to help you maximize the benefits of bpfsnitch.

## Configuration (soon)

### Customizing Syscall Monitoring

bpfsnitch comes with a predefined list of syscalls to monitor, focusing on critical operations that could affect system security or stability. We plan to provide a configurable syscall whitelist in future releases, allowing you to tailor monitoring to your specific needs.

#### Predefined Syscalls

```go
var WhitelistedSyscalls = []int{
    SyscallToId["clone"],
    SyscallToId["execve"],
    SyscallToId["mknodat"],
    SyscallToId["chroot"],
    SyscallToId["mount"],
    SyscallToId["umount2"],
    SyscallToId["pivot_root"],
    SyscallToId["setuid"],
    SyscallToId["setgid"],
    ...
```
